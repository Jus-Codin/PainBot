# Pain Bot

Hello! This is my discord bot one line implementation!

Do note that it is still buggy because I made it in a rush

The bot currently only has one command (well two if you count the built-in help command), but using this implementation it should be rather easy to add new commands (to some extent considering it's in one line)

The requirements for the bot is in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)

Also, do remember to add a `.env` file with a the key `DISCORD_TOKEN` for your discord bot token.
